This file looks at the different columns of our real estate data and determines:
1: If we will consider this to be a continuous or categorical variable and why
2: What we will do with any n/a values in a given columns (if there are n/a values)
3: How we will transform the data and use it in our analysis

ID: uniquely identifies each home
	1: We will look at this as a continuous column
	2: There are no n/a values
	3: We are not going to use this in our analyses as every value is unique to 
		a particular home

MSSubClass: Identifies the type of dwelling
	The types of dwelling include
		20: 1-STORY 1946 & NEWER ALL STYLES
        30: 1-STORY 1945 & OLDER
        40: 1-STORY W/FINISHED ATTIC ALL AGES
        45: 1-1/2 STORY - UNFINISHED ALL AGES
        50: 1-1/2 STORY FINISHED ALL AGES
        60: 2-STORY 1946 & NEWER
        70: 2-STORY 1945 & OLDER
        75: 2-1/2 STORY ALL AGES
        80: SPLIT OR MULTI-LEVEL
        85: SPLIT FOYER
        90: DUPLEX - ALL STYLES AND AGES
       120: 1-STORY PUD (Planned Unit Development) - 1946 & NEWER
       150: 1-1/2 STORY PUD - ALL AGES
       160: 2-STORY PUD - 1946 & NEWER
       180: PUD - MULTILEVEL - INCL SPLIT LEV/FOYER
       190: 2 FAMILY CONVERSION - ALL STYLES AND AGES
	1: Even though the column is numeric, we are going to look at this as a categorical variable for 2 reasons
		A: There are a finite number of categories
		B: It does not appear that increasing / decreasing numbers are correlated to the size or
			age of the house. The values 20 - 75 do appear to have larger homes as larger numbers
			but values 80 - 190 do not follow that same pattern
	2: There are no n/a values
	3: We are going to use this data to create new columns (that we may or may not use) indicating:
			1-story
			1-1/2-story
			2-story
			2-1/2-story
			Split or Multi-Level
			Split Foyer
			Duplex
			If itis a Planned Unit Development (PUD)
			If it is a 2 family conversion
		As you can see, I am leaving out whether it has an attic, and the age of the home as those metrics
		are not uniformly indicated across all categories.

MSZoning: Identifies the general zoning classification of the sale
	The zones included in this variable are:
		RL: Residential Low Density
		RM: Residential Medium Density
		RH: Residential High Density
		C: Commercial
		FV: Floating Village Residential
	1: We are going to treat this as a categorical variable because we have a finite number of strings
	2: There are no n/a values
	3: We are going to create new columns, but because most of the homes are residential and most
		of the residential homes are low density, we are going to create new categories
		A: Residential low density
		B: Residential medium to high density
		C: Other zoning type

LotFrontage: Linear feet of street connected to property
	1: We are going to treat this as a continuous variable for two reasons
		A: There are 110 different entries
		B: The number in this column gives us useful information about how connected the home is to the
			street outside
	2: There are 259 n/a values. Because the min of the data in this column is 21.0, we will assume
		that an n/a value means there are 0 feet of street connected to the property
	3: (after dealing with n/a values) We will use the data as-is

LotArea: Lot size in square feet
	1: We are going to treat this as a continuous variable for two reasons
		A: There are 1,073 different entries
		B: The number in this column gives us useful information about the size of the home
	2: There are no n/a values
	3: We will use the data as-is

Street: Type of road access to property
	This includes gravel or paved
	1: As there are only two values, this is definitely categorical
	2: There are no n/a values
	3: Because there are only 6 instances of gravel, I am going to change this column to indicate
		if the road is paved (1) or not (0)
	
Alley: Type of alley access to property
	This includes if the alley is gravel, paved, or if there is no alley access
	1: As there are only 3 opetions, this is definitely categorical
	2: There are 1,369 n/a values, but n/a here means there is no alley access, which is easy to indicate
	3: Because most of the homes do not have alley access, I am going to change this variable to indicate
		if there is alley access (1) or not (0)

LotShape: General shape of property
	Is on a scale that goes from regular through slightly and moderately irregular to irregular
	Reg:Regular	
	IR1: Slightly irregular
	IR2: Moderately Irregular
	IR3: Irregular
	1: As there are only 4 options, this looks like a categorical variable, but I am going to treat
		this like a continuous variable because the different values are correlated with how
		irregular the lot shape is
	2: There are no n/a values
	3: I am going to change the column to use numbers instead of strings
		Regular lot shape -> 0
		Slightly irregular -> 1
		Moderately irregular -> 2
		Irregular -> 3

LandContour: Flatness of the property
	Lvl: Near Flat/Level	
    Bnk: Banked - Quick and significant rise from street grade to building
    HLS: Hillside - Significant slope from side to side
    Low: Depression
	1: There are only 4 categories that do not and really can not follow a clear, linear progression
	2: There are no n/a values
	3: Because the vast majority of these values are level, I am going to change this column to
		indicate if the property is level (1) or not (0)

Utilities: Type of utilities available
	This column only contains 2 values:
		AllPub: All public Utilities (E,G,W,& S)
		NoSeWa: Electricity and Gas Only
	1: Definitely categorical
	2: There are no n/a values
	3: All of the entries except one have the value AllPub, so I am not going to use this column

LotConfig: Lot configuration
	Inside: Inside lot
    Corner: Corner lot
    CulDSac: Cul-de-sac
    FR2: Frontage on 2 sides of property
    FR3: Frontage on 3 sides of property
	1: As there are a finite set of values, this is categorical
	2: There are no n/a values
	3: I am going to create new columns to determine
		Inside
		Corner
		CulDSac
		Frontage (I am not going to distinguish between 2 and 3 sides as there are only 4 entries with
			frontage on 3 sides)

LandSlope: Slope of property
	Gtl: Gentle slope
	Mod: Moderate Slope	
	Sev: Severe Slope
	1: As there are only 3 values, it looks like a categorical variable, but I am going to treat it like
		a continuous variable as the 3 values increase in intensity of slope
	2: There are no n/a values
	3: I am going to change the column values to numbers instead of strings
		Gentle slope -> 0
		Moderate -> 1
		Severe -> 2

Neighborhood: Physical locations within Ames city limits
	1: As each of the values maps to a specific neighborhood, this is definitely a categorical variable
	2: There are no n/a values
	3: I am going to create new columns for each of the neighborhoods to indicate if the property is in 
		them or not. There is a very likely chance that a home being in a specific neighborhood will have
		a profound impact on the price.

Codition 1 and Condition 2: Proximity to various conditions
	Artery: Adjacent to arterial street
	Feedr: Adjacent to feeder street	
	Norm: Normal	
	RRNn: Within 200' of North-South Railroad
	RRAn: Adjacent to North-South Railroad
	PosN: Near positive off-site feature--park, greenbelt, etc.
	PosA: Adjacent to postive off-site feature
	RRNe: Within 200' of East-West Railroad
	RRAe: Adjacent to East-West Railroad
	1: As each of the values indicate a proximity to a given condition, this is categorical
	2: There are no n/a values
	3: Because these values are split across 2 different columns, I am going to turn each of the values
		into their own column and indicate if the property is near the given condition or not

BldgType: Type of dwelling
	1Fam: Single-family Detached	
	2FmCon: Two-family Conversion; originally built as one-family dwelling
	Duplx: Duplex
	TwnhsE: Townhouse End Unit
	TwnhsI: Townhouse Inside Unit
	1: As this column refers to different house types, it is categorical
	2: There are no n/a values
	3: There is some overlap between this column and the MSSubClass column (both of them have the value
		of Duplex) and the LotArea column (both have to do with the size of the home), so I am going
		to not use this column in my analysis

HouseStyle: Style of dwelling
	1Story: One story
	1.5Fin: One and one-half story: 2nd level finished
	1.5Unf: One and one-half story: 2nd level unfinished
	2Story: Two story
	2.5Fin: Two and one-half story: 2nd level finished
	2.5Unf: Two and one-half story: 2nd level unfinished
	SFoyer: Split Foyer
	SLvl: Split Level
	1: As this column refers to different house styles, it is categorical
	2: There are no n/a values
	3: There is some overlap between this column and the MSSubClass column (both of them have the number 
	of stories), so I am not going to use all of the data in this column. I will, however, use this
	column to create a new column indicating if the 2nd level is finished (1) or not (0)

OverallQual: Rates the overall material and finish of the house from 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest)
	1: Since higher numbers here are associated with higher quality, this is continuous
	2: There are no n/a values
	3: I am going to combine this data with OverallCond

OverallCond: Rates the overall condition of the house from 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest)
	1: Since higher numbers here are associated with better home condition, this is continuous
	2: There are no n/a values
	3: I am going to combine this data with OverallQual

Because Quality and Condition seem relatively similar, I am going to create 2 new columns that
combine the two scores.
	1: QualCondDiff that takes the difference of the 2 scores
	2: QualCondAvg that takes the average of the two scores

YearBuilt: Original construction date
	1: Since higher values mean newer homes, this is a continuous variable
	2: There are no n/a values
	3: I am going to use the data as-is

YearRemodAdd: Remodel date (same as construction date if no remodeling or additions)
	1: Since higher values mean newer remodels, this is a continuous variable
	2: There are no n/a values
	3: Because some homes have never been remodeled, I am going to change this into 2 columns
		A: Whether the home has been remodeled or not
		B: The number of years after the home was built that a remodel occurred

RoofStyle: Type of roof
	Flat: Flat
	Gable: Gable
	Gambrel: Gabrel (Barn)
	Hip: Hip
	Mansard: Mansard
	Shed: Shed
	1: Because each value refers to a different roof type, this is categorical
	2: There are no n/a values
	3: Most of the roof types are either Gable or Hip, so I am going to create 3 columns:
		A: The roof is Gable (1) or not (0)
		B: The roof is Hip (1) or not (0)
		C: The roof is of some other style (1) or not (0)

RoofMatl: Roof material
	ClyTile: Clay or Tile

	Membran: Membrane
	Metal: Metal
	Roll: Roll
	Tar&Grv: Gravel & Tar
	WdShake: Wood Shakes
	WdShngl: Wood Shingles
	1: Because each value refers to a different roof material, this is categorical
	2: There are no n/a values
	3: Because most of the roof types are CompShg, we are going to create a column that indicates if the
		roof is CompShg (1) or not (0)

	Wd Sdng: Wood Siding
	WdShing: Wood Shingles
	1: Because each value refers to a different exterior, this is categorical
	2: There are no n/a values
	3: Because these values are split across 2 different columns, I am going to turn each of the values
		into their own column and indicate if the property has that siding or not

MasVnrType: Masonry veneer type
	BrkCmn: Brick Common
	BrkFace: Brick Face
	CBlock: Cinder Block
	None: None
	Stone: Stone
	1: Because each value refers to a different vaneer type, this is categorical
	2: There are 8 n/a values, but I am not going to enter any values for them
	3: I am going to create new columns for each vaneer type and indicate if the property has that
		vaneer type or not

MasVnrArea: Masonry veneer area in square feet
	1: Because this column refers to an area, it is continuous
	2: There are 8 n/a values. I am going use the average of this column for these 8 values
	3: After dealing with n/a values, I am going to use this data as-is

ExterQual: Evaluates the quality of the material on the exterior 
	Ex: Excellent
	Gd: Good
	TA: Average/Typical
	Fa: Fair
	Po: Poor
	1: Because we can rank these from best to worst, this is a continuous variable
	2: There are no n/a values
	3: I am going to change this column to instead be strings to ints ranging from 5 (the best)
		to 1 (the worst) and then combine this variable with ExterCond

ExterCond: : Evaluates the present condition of the material on the exterior 
	Ex: Excellent
	Gd: Good
	TA: Average/Typical
	Fa: Fair
	Po: Poor
	1: Because we can rank these from best to worst, this is a continuous variable
	2: There are no n/a values
	3: I am going to change this column to instead be strings to ints ranging from 5 (the best)
		to 1 (the worst) and then combine this variable with ExterQual

Because Quality and Condition seem relatively similar, I am going to create 2 new columns that
combine the two scores.
	1: ExterQualCondDiff that takes the difference of the 2 scores
	2: ExterQualCondAvg that takes the average of the two scores

Foundation: Type of foundation
	BrkTil: Brick & Tile
	CBlock: Cinder Block
	PConc: Poured Contrete	
	Slab: Slab
	Stone: Stone
	Wood: Wood
	1: Because the values refer to different foundation types, this is categorical
	2: There are no n/a values
	3: Most of the foundation types are PConc, CBlock, or BrkTil, so I am going to make a new column
		for each of those types of foundations to indicate if a property has that foundation or not. I
		will also create an Other column to indicate if a property has another type of foundation

BsmtQual: Evaluates the height of the basement
	Ex: Excellent (100+ inches)	
	Gd: Good (90-99 inches)
	TA: Typical (80-89 inches)
	Fa: Fair (70-79 inches)
	NA: No Basement
	1: Beause this column buckets height into different categories, but those categories are correlated
		with a taller basement, this column could go either way
	2: There are n/a values, but n/a values mean that there is no basement
	3: I am going to keep this as one column, but I am going to change the values
		Ex -> 100
		Gd -> 90
		TA -> 80
		FA -> 70
		NA -> 0

BsmtCond: Evaluates the general condition of the basement
	Gd: Good
	TA: Typical - slight dampness allowed
	Fa: Fair - dampness or some cracking or settling
	Po: Poor - Severe cracking, settling, or wetness
	NA: No Basement
	1: Because we can rank these from best to worst, this is a continuous variable
	2: There are n/a values, but n/a values mean that there is no basement
	3: The vast majority of properties have a value of TA, so I don't think it would be useful
		to include this column

BsmtExposure: Refers to walkout or garden level walls
	Gd: Good Exposure
	Av: Average Exposure (split levels or foyers typically score average or above)	
	Mn: Mimimum Exposure
	No: No Exposure
	NA: No Basement
	1: Because we can rank these from most to least, this is a continuous variable
	2: There are n/a values, but n/a values mean that there is no basement
	3: I am going to change this column to rank exposure from 0 (no basement) to 4 (Good Exposure)

GarageCars: Size of garage in car capacity
	1: Because this refers to the number of things, this is continuous
	2: There are no n/a values
	3: I will use this column as-is

GarageArea: Size of garage in square feet

GarageCond: Garage condition
	Ex: Excellent
	Gd: Good
	TA: Typical/Average
	Fa: Fair
	Po: Poor

	3: I will use this column as-is

ScreenPorch: Screen porch area in square feet
	1: Because this refers to area, it is continuous
	2: There are no n/a values
	3: I will use this column as-is

PoolArea: Pool area in square feet
	1: Because this refers to area, it is continuous
	2: There are no n/a values
	3: I will use this column as-is

PoolQC: Pool quality
	Ex: Excellent
	Gd: Good
	TA: Average/Typical
	Fa: Fair
	NA: No Pool
	1: Because we can rank this from best to worst, this is a continuous variable
	2: n/a values indicate no pool
	3: Because most properties do not have a pool and we already have pool square footage to
		indicate if there is a pool or not, I am going to exclude this column
		
Fence: Fence quality
	GdPrv: Good Privacy
	MnPrv: Minimum Privacy
	GdWo: Good Wood
	MnWw: Minimum Wood/Wire
	NA: No Fence
	1: Because there is a mix of both privacy amount and quality of the fence, this is categorical
	2: n/a values indicate no fence
	3: Because most homes do not have a fence, I am going to change this column to indicate if the
		property has a fence (1) or not (0)
	
MiscFeature: Miscellaneous feature not covered in other categories
	Gar2: 2nd Garage (if not described in garage section)
	Othr: Other
	Shed: Shed (over 100 SF)
	TenC: Tennis Court
	NA: None
	1: Because each value refers to something completely different, this is categorical
	2: n/a values indicate there is no other feature to describe
	3: Because the vast majority of homes don't have any feature, I am going to exclude this column
		
MiscVal: $Value of miscellaneous feature
	1: Because this column describes value, this is continuous
	2: There are no n/a values
	3: Because I have excluded the above column, I will exclude this column

MoSold: Month Sold (MM)
	1: While each month can be described numerically, because different months are more or less
		desireable to move in (looking at the data, it seems that fewer homes are sold in the winter),
		I am going to treat this as a categorical variable
	2: There are no n/a values
	3: I am going to create new columns for each month to indicate if the home was sold in that month (1)
		or not(0)

YrSold: Year Sold (YYYY)
	1: While I have treated time as continuous before, because this has to do with the year of sale,
		and each year might have had different housing markets, I am going to treat this as a 
		categorical variable
	2: There are no n/a values
	3: I am going to create new columns for each year to indicate if the home was sold in that year (1)
		or not(0)

SaleType: Type of sale
	WD: Warranty Deed - Conventional
	CWD: Warranty Deed - Cash
	VWD: Warranty Deed - VA Loan
	New: Home just constructed and sold
	COD: Court Officer Deed/Estate
	Con: Contract 15% Down payment regular terms
	ConLw: Contract Low Down payment and low interest
	ConLI: Contract Low Interest
	ConLD: Contract Low Down
	Oth: Other
	1: Because each value refers to a different sale type, this is categorical
	2: There are no n/a values
	3: Because most sales were either Warranty Deed or New, I am going to create three new columns to
		indicate if the sale was Warranty Deed or not, New or not, or some Other type of sale
		
SaleCondition: Condition of sale
	Normal: Normal Sale
	Abnorml: Abnormal Sale -  trade, foreclosure, short sale
	AdjLand: Adjoining Land Purchase
	Alloca: Allocation - two linked properties with separate deeds, typically condo with a garage unit	
	Family: Sale between family members
	Partial: Home was not completed when last assessed (associated with New Homes)
	1: Because each value refers to a different condition type, this is categorical
	2: There are no n/a values
	3: Because most sales were either Normal, Partial, or Abnorml, I am going to create four new columns 
		to indicate if the sale was Normal or not, Partial or not, Abnorml or not, or some Other type of
		sale

SalePrice: The price the property sold for
	This is what we are trying to predict
